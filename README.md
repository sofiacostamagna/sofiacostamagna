## Hi 🖐🏽! 

I'm Sofía  a passionate Frontend developer with a specialized focus on UX/UI. I enjoy creating interactive and user-friendly interfaces that connect with users in a unique way. For me, technology is a constant adventure full of exciting possibilities.

My professional journey has been diverse. My experience in Human Resources provided me with strong skills in communication and personnel management. Successfully leading a COVID-19 vaccination campaign allowed me to develop leadership skills in a challenging and socially relevant environment.

Beyond the professional world, hockey is a passion that taught me the importance of teamwork and discipline to achieve shared goals. Additionally, living in Canada for a few months expanded my horizons by exposing me to diverse cultures and languages, an experience I deeply cherish.

As a developer, I am in a continuous learning mode, striving to improve my skills and challenging myself on innovative projects. My goal is to contribute to a dynamic and committed team where I can bring my enthusiasm and willingness to learn.

If you're interested in having a dedicated and motivated team member, I would love to be part of your team!
